Beef, oh beef, so savory and divine,
Grilled, roasted, or in a stew, you shine.
Tender cuts that melt in the mouth,
A culinary delight from north to south.

From ribeye to brisket, you never fail,
Juicy and flavorful, you always prevail.
In burgers, steaks, or a hearty pie,
Beef, you're the star that makes us sigh.

So versatile, you are a chef's best friend,
In every dish, your presence we commend.
Beef, oh beef, in every bite we find,
A taste that lingers, a memory enshrined.
